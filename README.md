# AB-Testing for New vs. Old Landing Page
# Project Overview
This repository contains the analysis for an A/B testing experiment conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new landing page compared to the old one. The experiment aims to determine whether the new landing page leads to increased user engagement and conversions.
# Experiment Design
## Participents
100 users were randomly selected for this experiment.
## Groups
The participants were divided equally into two groups:
Control Group: Users were shown the existing (old) landing page.
Treatment Group: Users were shown the new landing page.
## Data Collection
Data regarding user interactions with both landing page versions was collected, including the time spent on the page and conversion status.
